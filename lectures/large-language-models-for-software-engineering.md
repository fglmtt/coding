## 1. Large language models

### 1.1. What an LLM looks like

An LLM is an AI model that has been trained on large amounts of data and is able to generate text in a human-like fashion. For example, `llama-2-70b` has 70 billion parameters. Each parameter is a 16-bit floating-point value, thus `parameters` is around 140GB. This is what `llama-2-70b` looks like on the filesystem

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state llama-2-70b {
        parameters
        run.c
    }
    Note right of run.c: ~500 lines of code
    Note right of parameters: 140GB
```

### 1.2. Getting the parameters

#### 1.2.1. Pre-training

Computational complexity is not in running the model, but rather in getting the parameters. Think of it as compressing the Internet

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state llama-2-70b {
        Input: Chunk of the Internet
        Infrastructure: Cluster of GPUs
        Output: parameters
    }

    Input --> Infrastructure
    Infrastructure --> Output

    Note right of Input: 10TB of text
    Note right of Infrastructure: 6000 GPUs for 12 days (USD 2M)
```

`parameters` is like a `.zip` file. 10TB of text is zipped into 140GB of `parameters`—a 100x compression. But a caveat on the `.zip` file analogy: compression is lossy

#### 1.2.2. Objective function

Fundamentally, the objective of an LLM is to predict the next token in a sequence. The next-token prediction is a simple but powerful objective that forces to learn a lot about the world. This knowledge is compressed into `parameters`

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR

    Cat --> llm
    sat --> llm
    on --> llm
    a --> llm

    llm --> mat

    mat: mat (97%)
    llm: llama-2-70b
    output: Next word
    state llm {
        parameters
        run.c
    }
    state Prompt {
        Cat
        sat
        on
        a
    }
    state output {
        mat
    }
```

#### 1.2.3. Fine-tuning

The result of pre-training (see [§1.2.1](#121-pre-training)) is something like a document generator. Pre-training is just the first stage of training

The second stage of training is fine-tuning, which turns the document generator into an assistant. Fine-tuning maintains the same objective function as pre-training (see [§1.2.2](#122-objective-function)), but with a different data set

The data set used for fine-tuning is a set of manually-collected conversations written by people specifically hired for this purpose. A conversation is a document that follows a question-and-answer style

---

| Stage        | Quantity                  | Quality | Outcome            |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| Pre-training | Chunk of the Internet     | Low     | Document generator |
| Fine-tuning  | Hundreds of conversations | High    | Assistant          |

After fine-tuning, the LLM switches to a question-and-answer mode. Remarkably, not only can it answer questions about information learned during fine-tuning, but it can also access the knowledge it accumulated during pre-training

As a rule of thumb, pre-training gathers knowledge, while fine-tuning shapes that knowledge into the desired style

#### 1.2.4. Costs

### 1.3. Scaling hypothesis

> General methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin. The ultimate reason for this is Moore's law (the bitter lesson)
> 
> -- [Sutton, R.](https://heartyhaven.github.io/files/bitter_lesson.pdf)

> Model performance depends most strongly on scale, which consists of three factors: the number of model parameters, the size of the dataset, and the amount of compute. Performance has a power-law relationship with each of the three scale factors, when no bottlenecked by the other two
> 
> -- [Kaplan, J. et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361)

### 1.4. What could possibly go wrong

LLMs do not truly understand anything. Since LLMs are very good at figuring out which word statistically follows another, the answers they give often **sound** authoritative. However, LLMs hallucinate quite often (see [§1.4.1](#141-hallucinations))

Determinism often shows up in day-to-day programming

```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```

However, LLMs are probabilistic. In other words, same inputs may produce different outputs. This phenomenon is called non-determinism (see [§1.4.2](#142-determinism-v-non-determinism))

#### 1.4.1. Hallucinations

> A hallucination is an experience involving the apparent perception of something not present
> 
> -- Oxford English Dictionary

[Maynez, J. et al.](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.173/) investigated hallucinations in the context of abstractive summarizers, which may hallucinate by either misrepresenting information of the input document (intrinsic hallucination) or adding information not directly inferable from the input document (extrinsic hallucination)

There is no consensus if the summary should be faithful (i.e., without any hallucinations) to the input document or if there is tolerance for factual hallucinations (i.e., information not found in the input document but factually correct)

---

[Huang, L. et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3703155) proposed a taxonomy for hallucinations affecting LLMs

```mermaid
mindmap
    Hallucinations
        Factuality hallucinations
            Factual contradictions
                Relation-error hallucinations
                Entity-error hallucinations
            Factual fabrications
                Unverifiability hallucinations
                Overclaim hallucinations
        Faithfulness hallucinations
            Instruction inconsistencies
            Context inconsistencies
            Logical inconsistencies
```

##### 1.4.1.1. Factual contradictions

> [!note] Prompt
> What are Thomas Edison’s main contributions to science and technology?

```
Thomas Edison developed the first practical telephone and invented the light bulb
```

> [!bug] Explanation
> Edison improved the light bulb (relation-error hallucination), building on earlier designs by others, and Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone (entity-error hallucination)

##### 1.4.1.2. Factual fabrications

> [!note] Prompt
> What are the major environmental impacts of the construction of the Eiffel Tower?

```
The construction of the Eiffel Tower in 1889 led to the extinction of the Parisian tiger, a species that played a crucial role in the region’s ecosystem. Additionally, it is widely recognized as the event that sparked the global green architecture movement
```

> [!bug] Explanation
> There is no evidence of a “Parisian tiger” ever existing (unverifiability hallucination), and attributing the origins of green architecture to the Eiffel Tower is an exaggeration, as this movement has diverse roots and cannot be traced back to a single event (overclaim hallucination)

##### 1.4.1.3. Instruction inconsistencies

> [!note] Prompt
> Translate the English question into Spanish: “What is the capital of France?”

```
The capital of France is Paris
```

> [!bug] Explanation
> Paris is the capital of France, but the request was to translate the question not to answer it

##### 1.4.1.4. Context inconsistencies

> [!note] Prompt
> Summarize what follows: The Nile is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It’s traditionally considered the longest river in the world. Originating in the Great Lakes region of central Africa, it flows through several countries before emptying into the Mediterranean Sea
> 

```
The Nile originates from the mountain ranges of central Africa and flows into the Mediterranean
```

> [!bug] Explanation
> The summary incorrectly states that the Nile originates from the “mountain ranges of central Africa”, while the paragraph mentions that the Nile originates in the Great Lakes region of central Africa
##### 1.4.1.5. Logical inconsistencies

> [!note] Prompt
> Solve the equation $2x + 3 = 11$ step by step

```
Step 1: Subtract 3 from both sides to get: 2x = 8. 
Step 2: Divide both sides by 2 to get: x = 3. 
So the result of the equation is x = 3
```

> [!bug] Explanation
> The first step correctly isolates the term with $x$ to get $2x = 8$. However, the next step inaccurately divides 8 by 2 to yield a result of $x = 3$, which is inconsistent with the earlier reasoning

#### 1.4.2. Determinism v. non-determinism

> A model is deterministic if it is not possible for it to react in two or more ways to the same inputs
> 
> -- [Lee, E.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3453652)

Society heavily relies on deterministic models. The underlying physical realization is almost certainly not deterministic but sufficiently faithful to the deterministic model 

Most programming languages (except for concurrency) and the TCP/IP stack (in the sense that a stream of bits in yields the same stream of bits out, even though packets may be dropped or arrive out of order) are examples of deterministic models

---

There are many reasons determinism is valuable

| Reason                | Meaning                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Repeatability         | The behavior is repeatable given the same inputs                                                                                |
| Consensus             | Given the same input information, different agents will produce the same results                                                |
| Predictability        | If behaviors in response to certain inputs are predictable, then they do not need to be discovered again                        |
| Fault detection       | Any behavior that deviates from the correct behavior is<br>faulty behavior, meaning that some assumption has not been satisfied |
| Simplicity            | One input implies one behavior                                                                                                  |
| Unsurprising behavior | Often, we want engineered systems to be boring                                                                                  |
| Composability         | A clear understanding of the possible behaviors makes it easier to build larger systems                                         |

---

However, there are cases where we do not really care about determinism. Consider the serverless model. This model has many acceptable behaviors in response to a given input. In other words, it is irrelevant to correctness in what order and where these server functions are executed

And also we don't always want engineered systems to be boring. Non-deterministic models are fit for purpose here, as they are by definition unpredictable. For example, any AI attempting to exhibit human-like behavior needs to be surprising, and, therefore, at least appear to be non-deterministic

LLMs are non-deterministic, so forget about repeatability, predictability, fault detection, simplicity, unsurprising behavior, and composability

[Large Language Models for Software Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3695988)

### 2.1. Requirements engineering

The primary measure of success of a software system is the degree to which it meets the purpose for which it was intended

>Requirements engineering is the process of discovering the purpose for which a software system was intended, by identifying stakeholders and their needs, and documenting these in a form that is amenable to analysis, communication, and subsequent implementation
> 
> -- [Nuseibeh, B. and Easterbrook, S.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/336512.336523)

Whether requirements engineering is a branch of software engineering or systems engineering depends on the definition (e.g., [Zave, P.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/267580.267581))

---

Only a few works have explored LLMs for requirements engineering. However
- Requirements engineering has a long tradition of thinking about and coming up with methods to describe stakeholder needs precisely
- LLMs have natural language processing capabilities

> Requirements traceability is the ability to describe and follow the life of a requirement, in both a forwards and backwards direction
> 
> -- [Gotel, O. and Finkelstein, A.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/292398)

Identifying traceability links between requirements and other engineering artefacts, such as code and tests, is especially challenging because written in natural language—a natural fit for LLMs

### 2.2. Software development 

#### 2.2.1. Code generation and completion

Code completion is the area of software engineering where LLMs have been most thoroughly explored so far

To some extent, code completion sidesteps hallucination problems by acting as a recommender system to the developer, who is ultimately responsible to weed out hallucinations before integrating the generated content into the code base. Many software engineers already appear to have decided that the benefits outweigh any necessary human filtration effort

There are expectations that programmers will spend more time reviewing rather than writing code

---

Naturalness is about how a language is actually used in daily tasks. Although English can accommodate arbitrarily complex expressions, everyday human communication is often simple, expedient, and even repetitive

Programming is as much an act of communication, from one human to another, as it is a way to tell computers what to do

> Programming languages, in theory, are complex, flexible and powerful, but, “natural” programs, the ones that real people actually write, are mostly simple and rather repetitive; thus they have usefully predictable statistical properties that can be captured in statistical language models and leveraged for software engineering tasks
> 
> -- [Hindle, A. et al](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2337223.2337322)

---

Automated program repair is based on the assumption that program source code changes that occur during development can often be constructed from grafts

> Changes to a codebase contain snippets that already exist in the codebase at the time of the change, and these snippets can be efficiently found and exploited (the plastic surgery hypothesis)
> 
> -- [Barr, E. et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2635868.2635898)

The plastic surgery hypothesis has two parts: changes are repetitive relative to their parent (they showed that changes are 43% graftable on average) and this repetitiveness is usefully exploitable (they found that the parent is by far the most fecund donor and grafts are often contiguous)

---

Prompt engineering has been extensively used as a way to improve code generation

Prompt engineering is the iterative process of developing a prompt by modifying or changing the prompt engineering technique, which is a strategy for iterating on a prompt to improve it

In consumer settings, users often perform prompt engineering manually without any assistive tooling. However, prompt engineering is often poorly understood, with only a fraction of existing techniques being well-known among practitioners

---

While the current focus of research is on the code generated by LLMs, the explanations produced alongside that code may prove to be just as important

It is easy to imagine that a software engineer would prefer to accept a (possibly) suboptimal artefact that comes with a compelling explanation, over a potentially more performant solution with a less compelling explanation

After all, engineers regularly make the same judgement call for human-designed engineering artefacts, so why would we expect it to be any different for those produced by machines?

### 2.3. Software quality assurance

#### 2.3.1. Software testing

Software testing is the act of checking whether software satisfies expectations. Testing is iterative and may involve multiple cycles of the following stages, depending on the complexity of the system under test and testing requirements

```mermaid

```

```

---

Various types of tests may be performed

| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit test        | Isolated source code (i.e., a component) is tested to validate expected behavior               |

| System test      | The complete software system is tested                                                         |

Wang, J. et al. observed that as LLMs get better, researchers tend to rely on prompt engineering rather than pre-training and/or fine-tuning

```mermaid

[Software Testing With Large Language Models: Survey, Landscape, and Vision](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TSE.2024.3368208)

---

As code generation is generally driven by what is most likely rather than what is most correct, hallucinations threaten correctness

> A test oracle is a procedure that distinguishes between the correct and incorrect behaviors of the system under test
> 
> -- [Barr, E. et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TSE.2014.2372785)

The lack of a test oracle is particularly relevant when generating brand-new software. This, however, is not always the case. For example, there is a readily-available test oracle when adapting, improving, and developing existing software—the functional behavior of the original system

---

The oracle problem also plays a role in test generation. A new test either passes or fails on the current release

Suppose the test passes. We might assume that the functionality is correctly tested and the generated test thus can be used as a regression test against which future changes can be checked. However, a test that passes may merely reflect coincidental correctness or, worse, capture and thereby enforce an incorrect behavior

Suppose the test fails. This may indicate a bug. However, should it turn out that the ratio of false to true positives is high, then the human oracle cost may make the technique impractical

### 2.4. Maintenance

#### 2.4.1. Debugging and automated program repair

Debugging is the process of finding the root cause, workarounds, and possible fixes for bugs. LLMs have already proved to work well for fault localization and fault explainability

Once a bug is found, the programmer is typically responsible to fix it. Automated program repair—the automatic repair of software bugs without the intervention of a human programmer—has been a topic of interest for over a decade in the software engineering research community

As LLMs are prone to hallucinate, LLM-driven automated program repair is no exception. Scalability is also a main concern when automated repair relies on generate-and-test ([build effort problem](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3524459.3527353))

#### 2.4.2. Performance improvement

In the 1970s, the strongest concern was about correctness. Software transformation consisted solely of steps that were correct by construction

In the 2010s, the tight semantic straitjacket of the 1970s was already considerably relaxed to allow transformations that might even fail some tests. The strongest concern became to retain sufficient operational faithfulness. The rationale was that no software can be considered functionally correct when executed on a system in which inefficiency has left insufficient remaining resources

Today, software generated by LLMs may not even be syntactically correct, let alone semantically. Testing is even more important to assure functional faithfulness and check for regressions in those non-functional properties that are not targeted by the improvement process

#### 2.4.3. Refactoring

Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. The objective is to improve non-functional properties (e.g., design) while preserving functionality

By definition, code refactoring does not change semantics. This means that LLM-based refactoring can rely on the automated regression oracle

Up to a third of software engineering effort is spent on largely repetitive, tedious, and potentially error-prone refactoring activities. For example, LLMs may help software engineers to refactor existing code to use design patterns, integrate new technologies, or implement project-specific refactoring requirements
